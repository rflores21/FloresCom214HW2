Project MKUltra was a top-secret CIA project that conducted hundreds of experiments, sometimes on unwitting U.S. citizens, to assess the potential use of drugs for mind control, information gathering, and psychological torture.
#The program, which lasted from 1953 until about 1973, didnâ€™t become public until 1975, during a congressional investigation into widespread illegal CIA activities within the United States and around the world.
