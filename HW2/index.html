        <h1>Origins and purpose of MKUltra</h1>
        <p>Project MKUltra was a covert CIA program conducted during the Cold War era, tracing back to the 50's. Driven on concerns of mind controll, interrogation techniques, and chemical manipulation, the project aimed to explore methods of influencing human behavior, often through unethical experiments such as drugs, hypnosis, and psychological torture.</p>

        <h2>Controversial Experiments</h2>
        <p>The experiments were covered in secrecy sand controversy. Researchers subjected unwitting victims -such as prisoners, mental patients, or military personal- with mind altering substances such as LSD to try and create "Manchurian candidates" who could be controlled. These unethical experiments remain a heated topic of debate due to the violation of basic human rights and consent.</p>

        <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>
        <p>Despite its discovery and termination happening in the 1970s, it has left an impact on society such as revealing the dangers of unregulated government experimentation. The legacy of this event serves as a warning, reminding us of the delicate balance between scientific exploration and ethical boundaries.</p>

            <p>In 1972 Gottlieb, head of the project, dismissed his effort as useless. Files discovered in 1977 has 700 pages of new information showing that experimentation continued until July 10, 1972, when Gottlieb ordered the program to halt.</p>
